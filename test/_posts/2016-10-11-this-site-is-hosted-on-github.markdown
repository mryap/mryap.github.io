This makes it official. There is no turning back. I am now hosting my website on GitHub instead of Wordpress in a bid to save USD 119 on hosting.   

For the past Sept/Oct, I get my head around using GitHub as the “CMS” to drive my site. Various options are explored. Siteleaf is worth looking into. It use as the middleman to “push” markdown file at GitHub to the final output (i.e. http://iworkwithdata.siteleaf.net).

It a learning curve to negotatie after accumulating considerable experience on Wordpress and transiting to GitHub. WordPress is a content management system driven by MySQL, an open-source database. I have being using WordPress CMS to manage my site when it was first introduce.

As a freelancer, I remember one of my paying project involves moving a website to a WordpRess without losing any existing content and minimise downtime. Focusing on SME sector, I always advocate the use of WordPress as a CMS for their business website as it allows them to update content.
