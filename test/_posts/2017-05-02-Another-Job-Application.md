title: Job Application for a digital marketing role
---
Submitted a CV this morning. Phone rang in the afternoon and I jumped on it. Turn out it just a sale call from Virgin Media !@#$V

Instead of a coverletter, I emailed a proposal what I would do if I am hired for the role. I hope this standouts from a sea of applications. 

The organisation is a small tech firm in Dublin, Ireland. It host free open-source software (FOSS) monitoring tool in the cloud as a service.
