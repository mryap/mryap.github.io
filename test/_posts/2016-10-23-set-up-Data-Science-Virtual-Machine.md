Using Microsoft Azure, I put a suite of Data Science applications on a Windows machine that people get remote access to. It like Citrix. 

The way to access the remote desktop is via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Thumbs up for Microsoft for integrating open source applications like R, Python, Juypter Notebook besides its own Power BI Desktop, Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL database in the cloud
