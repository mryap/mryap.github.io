I play around with IBM Data Science Experience. I got to wrestle with Spark, Instances & Object Storage to get started! I lose the will to live so to speak.

For a start, to upload data you need to set up Object Storage Thingy.

To open up a Jupyter notebook, you need to connect to a Spark Instances. 

Contrast with IBM https://datascientistworkbench.com/  All configured and ready to go.

From IBM Data Scientist Work Bench website

> We took the liberty to put together a starter kit using IPython notebooks with support for Python, R and Scala with all sorts of popular libraries. We added Spark and connectivity to Hadoop clusters and relational databases. We also integrated RStudio IDE because it is very popular with the R data scientists and we added OpenRefine for those who like to eyeball, clean and prepare their data through a spreadsheet-like interface instead of writing code. We then decided to host it for you on the cloud and maintain everything at the latest levels so you can concentrate on data science instead of system administration. However, we do realize that many of you can't put your data and code on the cloud so we are architecting DSWB in such a way that you can deploy it inside your company's firewall. We also heard loud and clear that from time to time you want to be able to use these tools on your laptop with or without an internet connection. As a result, you can bring components of DSWB on to your laptop and go back to the cloud only when you want to.
