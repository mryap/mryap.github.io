Using version control is a sign of a professional approach to serious data analysis. It about faciliating reproducible research.

"Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them." [1]  
 
The importance of version control is widely recognised. It taught in courses like 
the Johns Hopkins The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox on Coursera, and in software carpentry and data carpentry courses 
aimed at (previously) non-programming researchers. Insead business school incorporates version control using GitHub in [one of its course](https://github.com/InseadDataAnalytics/INSEADAnalytics). 

I look forward NCI to introduce [Reproducible Research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) in its Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analysis course for future batch of students.
