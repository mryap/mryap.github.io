RMOTR Notebooks bills itself as a "Jupyter Notebooks as a Service". It allows you
to have a data science environment in the cloud. No need to spin up you own
Jupyter Notebooks on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP or Azure.

My impression of RMOTR Notebooks is the whole process is fast. The response is
instantaneous the moment you execute a cell of code or markdown in the browser.
It offers a generous 512MB RAM - 60 times more than the RAM on my laptop! It
offers the official Jupyter Notebook interface unlike the Kaggle Kernel.

The following are packages that are available on RMOTR by I execute a `pip freeze`
command in its Terminal.

```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you subscribe to the creeds of not building your own data science infrastructure,
[RMOTR Notebooks](https://nb.rmotr.com/i/AzKtgR) could be an options for you.
