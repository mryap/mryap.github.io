R code for acquiring data
```r
library(jsonlite)
yelp <- fromJSON("https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd1k41y9gbpfwq3/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json")
```
‘jsonlite’ actually has a function to deal with this ‘NDJSON’ file type with ‘stream_in()’ function

Use ‘file()’ function to create a ‘connection’ for accessing to the files on your disk when you 
use ‘stream_in()’ function.

53MB JSON data upload to R Studio. To import, add " marks [References](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617600/importing-data-from-a-json-file-into-r/50965690#50965690)

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
yelp <- stream_in(file("yelp_academic_dataset_business.json"))
```


```{r}
head(yelp,10)
```
Find out how the data has been imported by quickly running ‘str()’ function.
```{r}
str(yelp)
```
Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
