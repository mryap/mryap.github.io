R code for acquiring data

```r
library(jsonlite)
yelp <- fromJSON("https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd1k41y9gbpfwq3/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json")
```
`jsonlite` actually has a function to deal with this `NDJSON` file type with `stream_in()` function

Use `file()` function to create a "connection" for accessing to the files on your disk when you 
use `stream_in()` function.
