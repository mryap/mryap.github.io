To proceed to a postgraduate course, I am require to put together a REPL (pronouced as R-PEL) portfolio.

The purpose of RPEL is to allow you to demonstrate that through lived experience one have achieved equivalent outcomes to those achieved through formal education.

Here what I did 

- I have done the coursework for my HDSDA, I will re-purpose the coursework as evidence. These coursework to be attached to the portfolio 
- Reproducible data analysis for some reason is missing from HDSDA course, I took it upon myself to replicate and make available on GitHub. Do you think a link to GitHub is suffice enough? 
- I blogged about what I did and achieved before the course. I provide individual links to those post. 

A google search leads me to CPD. CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development. It refers to the process of tracking and documenting the skills, knowledge and experience that you gain both formally 
and informally as you work, beyond any initial training. It's a record of what you experience, learn and then apply. [1]

Here how I would go about documenting the learning experience

- Date	
- What did you do?
- Why?	
- Lesson Learn	
- Further Action

The fact that I am blogging this is also in my view a process of recording what I experience and learn.
