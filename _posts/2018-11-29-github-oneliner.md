Github is a vital toolbox for anyone working with machine learning project, code and even content management.

These 5 Git commands can keep you productive to share your work with other team members. I picked this up because the course I enrolled in does not include in their curriculum.

`git status`

`git remote -v`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "message goes here"`

`git push`

These 5 commands allows you

- to check what going on in your project folder (a.k.a Repositories)
- what the git Repositories on Github
- add what you need to save to Github
- upload the source code
