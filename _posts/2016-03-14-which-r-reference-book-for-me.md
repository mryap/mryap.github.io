Most R books are written by authors from their domains perspective. This post I will starts off with bio science.

<b>Bio science Domain</b>

Go for the 2nd edition if you can. The review of the first edition is [here] (http://lukemiller.org/index.php/2013/05/book-review-the-r-book-second-edition-2013/).

To get best value from this book, put yourself in one of the following categories, then go to the appropriate category heading within this section

- Beginner in both computing and statistics (Section 1.1.1);
- Student needing help with project work (1.1.2);
- Done some R and some statistics, but keen to learn more of both (1.1.3);
- Done regression and ANOVA, but want to learn more advanced statistical modelling (1.1.4);
- Experienced in statistics, but a beginner in R (1.1.5);
- Experienced in computing, but a beginner in R (1.1.6);
- IF you do not have the inclination to wade thru a 1076 pages of the above book, checkout UCDâ€™s Dr Jon Yearsley (School of Biology and Environmental Science, UCD) resource.
