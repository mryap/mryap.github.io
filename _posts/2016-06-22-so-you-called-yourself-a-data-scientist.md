There should be a law where people canâ€™t call themselves data scientist unless

- the title being conferred by a recognised award association,
- wrote a peer-reviewed IEEE published relevant research paper,
- develop and contribute a R/Python package,
- work with GB of structured and unstructured data daily
- and graduated with a Master Degree.
